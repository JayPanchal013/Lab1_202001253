* Security Requirements: We need to develop a secured database for the university.There are different categories of users namely faculty, administrator, library staff ,students etc. Depending upon the category of user the access rights are decided. It means if the user is an administrator then he can be able to modify the data, delete, append etc., all other users other than library staff only have the rights to retrieve the information about the database.<br>
